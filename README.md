# flutter_app_icons

Dynamic App Icon, for a beginning this will only be for web favicon, because there is no way to change that with flutter, for later it is intended that we support app icons on Android and iOS.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.
